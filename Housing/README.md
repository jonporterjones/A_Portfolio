These notebooks are meant to demonstrate a small portion of the lifecycle of an ML project.

The lifecycle is to:

- Explore and understand the data.
- Build a naive baseline. A naive baseline does not use input features, only the target value.
- Build a learned baseline. This must beat the naive baseline to indicate an ability to learn from input features.
- Iterate and beat the learned baseline. These notebooks accomplish this with a simple RandomForest model.

The dataset used is the [California Housing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset) dataset, packaged as part of sklearn.

This is a simple and contrived example to demonstrate

- Solving a simple regression problem with sklearn
- A portion of the ML project lifecycle
