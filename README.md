This repository will serve as a small portfolio of my work in the ML space.  A brief outline of what I plan to build:

* Housing - A simple demonstration project of a regression problem using Sklearn.  The purpose here is to demonstrate the importance of baselines in the ML space.

* Neural Network From Scratch - A demonstration of a Neural Network build without using any of the usual deep learning frameworks.  This will demonstrate both a regression and a classification problem.

* TensorFlow - A simple demonstration of a neural network built with TensorFlow.

* PyTorch - A simple demonstration of a neural network built with PyTorch.
